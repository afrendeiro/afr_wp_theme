WP_labnotebook
============
An electronic lab notebook based on wordpress
------------
This wordpress theme is intended for researchers who wish to have an electronic record of their scientific research (such as [me](http://andre-rendeiro.me)).

It provides a **Lab Notebook completely independent of a blog**, which might exist or not.

'WP_labnotebook' is based on the [Bare Responsive template](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/wordpress-responsive-template/).

# Lab notebook

### 'labnotebook' post type
Entries added through the 'Lab Notebook' front end page are automatically of the type 'labnotebook'. This allows separation of the Lab Notebook from the Blog posts.

### Taxonomies
Three custom taxonomies are predefined within the 'labnotebook' post types:
- Protocols
- Experiments
- Analysis

Which allows categorization of Lab Notebook items and proper labeling by type of post in the title.

### Editor
I include styles (two, for now) appropriate for text in posts which requires different treatment such as citations.

# Page templates
There are several types of page templates available:
- About page
- Research page
- Front page

You can use any page (blog, lab notebook, about, etc.) for your front page, but I also provide a 'Front page' template, which doesn't include sidebars or footer.
