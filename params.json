{"name":"Wp labnotebook","tagline":"An electronic lab notebook based on wordpress","body":"WP_labnotebook\r\n============\r\nAn electronic lab notebook based on wordpress\r\n------------\r\nThis wordpress theme is intended for researchers who wish to have an electronic record of their scientific research (such as [me](http://andre-rendeiro.me)).\r\n\r\nIt provides a **Lab Notebook completely independent of a blog**, which might exist or not.\r\n\r\n'WP_labnotebook' is based on the [Bare Responsive template](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/wordpress-responsive-template/).\r\n\r\n# Lab notebook\r\n\r\n### 'labnotebook' post type\r\nEntries added through the 'Lab Notebook' front end page are automatically of the type 'labnotebook'. This allows separation of the Lab Notebook from the Blog posts.\r\n\r\n### Taxonomies\r\nThree custom taxonomies are predefined within the 'labnotebook' post types:\r\n- Protocols\r\n- Experiments\r\n- Analysis\r\n\r\nWhich allows categorization of Lab Notebook items and proper labeling by type of post in the title.\r\n\r\n### Editor\r\nI include styles (two, for now) appropriate for text in posts which requires different treatment such as citations.\r\n\r\n# Page templates\r\nThere are several types of page templates available:\r\n- About page\r\n- Research page\r\n- Front page\r\n\r\nYou can use any page (blog, lab notebook, about, etc.) for your front page, but I also provide a 'Front page' template, which doesn't include sidebars or footer.","google":"UA-44246232-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
